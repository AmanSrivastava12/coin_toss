Short Summary -
It is a simple coin toss implementation. Quite a number of people use coin tossing apps/websites for making a particular decision in their life, that may or may not be important. However, one or more functionalities are missing in most of the apps/websites. Through this implementation, I have tried to put in every functionality that is possible in a coin toss website. A user may toss coins by selecting his/her choice, and he/she gets a record of how many times he/she has won/lost.
